# Genetic Curve Fitting

The objective of this project was to build a genetic algorithm that would find the best coefficients to fit a polynomial to a list of points.

I don't explain the whole project here, instead I wrote an [introductory blog post](http://maxhalford.com/2015/08/02/genetic-algorithms-introduction.html) on genetic algorithms and more specifically the curve fitting problem.
